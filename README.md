Project Description: Analysis of Athletes' Rating Increase by Country and Sport from 2016 to 2020

The project aims to analyze the dataset containing a comprehensive list of the world's highest-paid athletes since 1990, with records available until the year 2020. The dataset includes information on athletes' names, nationalities, current and previous year ranks, sports they participate in, the corresponding year of the record, and their earnings in millions of dollars.

Research Question: The specific research question for this project is to identify the country and sport in which athletes experienced an increase in their world ranking from 2016 to 2020.

Methodology:

1. Data Preparation: The project begins with data preprocessing, including data cleaning, handling missing values (if any), and ensuring consistency and accuracy of the dataset.

2. Selection of Relevant Data: The focus is on the years 2016 to 2020, as the research question specifically relates to this time period. The relevant columns for analysis include "Name," "Nationality," "Current rank," "Previous year rank," "Sport," "Year," and "Earnings ($ million)."

3. Filtering Data: The dataset is filtered to include records from 2016 and 2020. Athletes who have ranking information available for both years will be considered for further analysis.

4. Calculation of Rating Increase: For each athlete, the rating increase is calculated by comparing their world ranking in 2016 to their ranking in 2020. The athletes with a higher rank in 2020 will be identified as having an increase in their rating.

5. Aggregation by Country and Sport: The dataset is aggregated based on the athletes' nationalities and sports. The total count of athletes with rating increase is calculated for each country and sport combination.

6. Identification of Countries and Sports with Rating Increase: By analyzing the aggregated data, the project will identify the countries and sports where athletes had a consistent increase in their rating from 2016 to 2020. This analysis will help understand the trends and patterns in terms of athlete performance and popularity.

7. Visualization and Reporting: The results will be visualized using appropriate charts, graphs, and tables to present the findings effectively. The project will generate insights about the countries and sports with the most significant rating increase during the specified time period.

The analysis of athletes' rating increase by country and sport from 2016 to 2020 provides valuable insights into the evolving landscape of top-ranked athletes worldwide. By examining the dataset and addressing the research question, this project contributes to a better understanding of the factors influencing athletes' success and popularity in different countries and sports over the specified time frame.
